# Protection

Here we discuss how to protect biometric templates against reconstruction by means of encoding with key generated from photo 

## Scheme of work

## How we will protect templates

Protection demos have been moved:

 - [protection against decoder](../train_naive_decoder/protection_demo.py)
 - [protection against adapter](../train_adapter_for_instantid/protection_demo.py)

They demonstrate effectiveness of the same protection method against two reconstruction methods.
